# Project Name
English Premier League
## Description
In this project, I am developing a system to predict the winning team of the English Premier League using historical data from multiple seasons.

The project includes:

Data Collection: Gathering historical match results, team performance metrics, player statistics, and other factors that may influence a team's success.
Data Processing and Analysis: Cleaning the data, feature engineering, and identifying meaningful patterns.
Building Prediction Models: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to create a model capable of predicting the team with the highest chances of winning the championship.
Performance Evaluation: Testing the model on past data and comparing its predictions with actual results to assess its accuracy.
The goal of this project is to identify key trends that contribute to success in the league and improve the ability to predict Premier League season outcomes. âš½ðŸ“Š
